Description

Medocket is an Android application designed to manage and track medical records efficiently. This project leverages modern Android development practices, structured architecture, and a user-friendly interface to provide an intuitive and reliable experience for its users.

Features
	•	Simple and efficient medical record management
	•	Secure data storage using Room Database
	•	Intuitive navigation following Material Design principles
	•	Integration with RESTful APIs for external data exchange
	•	Smooth image loading and caching with Glide
	•	Scalable architecture with MVVM pattern and Hilt for dependency injection

Interesting Techniques Used
	•	MVVM Architecture: Enables a clear separation of concerns and makes the codebase maintainable and scalable (Documentation).
	•	LiveData and ViewModel: Ensures lifecycle-aware, reactive UI updates (Documentation).
	•	Room Database: Provides efficient data storage with SQLite under the hood (Documentation).
	•	Retrofit: Simplifies integration with RESTful APIs (Documentation).
	•	Dependency Injection with Hilt: Manages app dependencies effectively (Documentation).
	•	Material Design Components: Follows Material Design guidelines for polished and consistent UI (Documentation).

Libraries and Tools
	•	Retrofit: HTTP client for API requests
	•	Hilt: Dependency injection framework
	•	Room: Data persistence library
	•	Material Components: UI design framework
	•	Glide: Image loading and caching library
	•	JUnit and Espresso: For unit and UI testing
